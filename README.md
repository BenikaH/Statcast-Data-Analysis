# Statcast-Data-Analysis
Files used to manage and analyze data from MLB Statcast

Early development of files to manage downloaded data from MLB statcast

Currently written to only handle pitching data downloaded from BaseballSavant.com. Future methods will take data from additional sources.

File title "statcast_data_analysis.py" is now the outdated file. Debugged and works for limited analysis functions. Will be removed after the new files are improved and further utilized

Files utilized in improved encapsulated data set-up:
  statcast_analysis_main.py
  pitching_data_functions.py
  pitcher.py
  game.py
  pitch.py
